2018-02-15 15:44:39.217 ASCIILoggerSample.iOS[92572:11202117] The behavior of the UICollectionViewFlowLayout is not defined because:
2018-02-15 15:44:39.217 ASCIILoggerSample.iOS[92572:11202117] the item width must be less than the width of the UICollectionView minus the section insets left and right values, minus the content insets left and right values.
2018-02-15 15:44:39.218 ASCIILoggerSample.iOS[92572:11202117] The relevant UICollectionViewFlowLayout instance is <UICollectionViewFlowLayout: 0x7fc8fd41e690>, and it is attached to <UICollectionView: 0x7fc8ff953000; frame = (0 64; 379 603); clipsToBounds = YES; autoresize = RM+BM; gestureRecognizers = <NSArray: 0x608000059380>; layer = <CALayer: 0x60000083cc00>; contentOffset: {0, 0}; contentSize: {414, 0}; adjustedContentInset: {0, 0, 0, 0}> collection view layout: <UICollectionViewFlowLayout: 0x7fc8fd41e690>.
